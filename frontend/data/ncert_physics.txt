CHAPTER: Laws of Motion
- Newton's First Law: A body remains in rest or uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.
- Newton's Second Law: Force = mass × acceleration (F = ma)
- Momentum (p) = m × v
- Newton's Third Law: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

CHAPTER: Work, Power and Energy
- Work = Force × Displacement × cos(θ)
- Power = Work done / Time
- Kinetic Energy = ½ m v²
- Potential Energy = m g h
- Total mechanical energy is conserved in the absence of friction.

CHAPTER: Light – Reflection and Refraction
- Mirror formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u
- Lens formula: 1/f = 1/v - 1/u
- Magnification (m) = h₂/h₁ = v/u
