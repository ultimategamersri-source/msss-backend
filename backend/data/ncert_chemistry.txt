CHAPTER: Structure of Atom
- Proton: +1 charge, mass = 1 amu
- Neutron: neutral, mass = 1 amu
- Electron: -1 charge, negligible mass
- Atomic number (Z) = number of protons
- Mass number (A) = protons + neutrons

CHAPTER: Chemical Reactions
- Law of conservation of mass: Matter cannot be created or destroyed.
- Types of reactions: Combination, Decomposition, Displacement, Double Displacement, Oxidation–Reduction.
- Example: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

CHAPTER: Periodic Classification
- Mendeleev arranged elements based on increasing atomic mass.
- Modern periodic law: Properties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers.
